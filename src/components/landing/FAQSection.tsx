  {
    question: "Do I need to format notes?",
    answer: "No, free-form. Just dump whatever's on your mindâ€”Olive handles all the organization, categorization, and structuring automatically."
  },
  {
    question: "Will Olive guess wrong?",
    answer: "You can confirm/adjust; Olive learns preferences. The AI gets better over time as it learns how you and your partner organize tasks and assign ownership."
  },
  {
    question: "How do owners work?",
    answer: "Uses your names; you can change per task. Olive automatically detects who should handle what based on context, but you can always reassign tasks manually."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data private and secure?",
    answer: "Yes. We use Clerk for authentication and Supabase for secure data storage. Your notes are encrypted and only accessible by you and your partner."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I keep some notes private?",
    answer: "Yes, toggle Private/Shared. You can mark any note as private so only you can see it, while keeping shared notes visible to both partners."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I export my data?",
    answer: "Yes. You can export your tasks to popular calendar apps (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar) and download your notes in standard formats."
  },
  {
    question: "What platforms do you support?",
    answer: "Olive works in any web browser on desktop and mobile. We're planning native mobile apps based on user feedback during beta."
  },
  {
    question: "What's on your roadmap?",
    answer: "Native mobile apps, advanced recurring task patterns, integration with more calendar and productivity apps, and enhanced AI capabilities based on user feedback."
